DESIGN
The website has two parts in general: one for volunteers and one for charity organizations. Using different decorators and session IDs,
the pages load different by changing tabs or actually being directed to different html pages.
By utilizing two different databases for volunteers and charities, the website is able to access information that are submitted from
both sides to achieve certain effect. For example, in volunteers database, there are profile, experience as well as volunteering time
tables that each entity uploads their data to. In the case of history, organizations add data according to the volunteerâ€™s name
corresponding to a certain ID in volunteer database and that is accessed to generate a list for students to check their volunteering
history and see the details.
Another is image submission for profile picture through defining the path and storing the path in the database and not the image for
quicker access to the images and displayed well using CSS and html styles.
The website uses Google Maps API to store the address of an individual as well as that of an organization. The main purpose was to
be able to search also through distance by doing calculations that allow calculating distance from geolocation points. But, that is
left as comments as checking through each and every location just for distance can take time and will not be a good design. Other
searches such as category and name of organization are fully functioning.
With around 21 html pages, 2 databases with 4 tables in total as well as application and helper function, this website is able to
utilize big amount of data and display in a user friendly way.
