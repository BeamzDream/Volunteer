DOCUMENTATION
VolunteerAddis is a website created to connect volunteers with the charities they care about. With volunteers and organizations both
able to create account, they are able to update their personal information, access stories about volunteering in Addis as well as access
the different resources allowing search as well as accessing history. For volunteers, they are able to update their personal information,
search for organizations based on values such as names, categories as well as distance from home or personal address as well as access
history of volunteering input by the organizations. Organizations can also register and manage their page as well as add time of volunteering
for volunteers.

The project submitted runs the same way as that of finance where “flask run” is used to run website under terminal “/Project.” The
website also consists of features that have been disabled due to Gmail’s security verification such as registration confirmation,
feedback and email confirmation for password change. But, the website is easy to use and tabs can be easily accessed. The website
also uses different decorators and session IDs to load different pages of volunteer and organization.
