# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

“Volunteer Addis”

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website for volunteers to register their profiles as well as register for volunteer organizations and connect

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Sign up, sign in, log out or delete pages for students willing to volunteer
Student database, accessible only through password and changed using account confirmation through email, containing details important for registering such as name, contact, image and more
Number of hours worked as well as recommendations that can be uploaded into database by organizations and keep track of those
Organizations search page using categories or location (through integration with Google maps)
Gmail integration for communication between volunteers and volunteer organization
Multiple HTMLs beautifully designed with CSS and JavaScript containing student profiles, organization profiles and more


## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

No

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Be able to integrate database and web programming to form a well designed volunteering website

Through this final project, I tend to learn more on database management including differentiated access, file uploads and categorized and efficient data. Also, I plan to learn more about API and Google Maps integration to the system. Better CSS and JavaScript usage and user friendly website.
