Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far, I have outlined what the whole website structure would look like (listing what would be included in each page) including
what elements of CSS, JavaScript, Python and HTML to use for it. I have also looked into how to Google Maps API as well as uploading
and using images. I have created the basic structure of website using previous P-Sets as a model and trying to make smaller details
work for database management.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

The major thing I have not done so far is CSS configuration for the website as I plan to make it as user friendly and aesthetic.
Another would be Google API integration to website where I learned about API but have not used it yet in the website. Other than that,
everything is working in a good progress.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

None so far. As website gets more detailed and complex, there may be some problems that will be encountered which I plan to discuss
with my TA.
