# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
1. Website for volunteering in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia where volunteer organizations and students can connect with each other. It will include:
    * Beautiful website aesthetics like current webpages
    * Password protected SQL database for storing student's and volunteer coordinator's information
    * User's site for registration and communication with organizers
    * Searching categories depending on focus of organization or distance using Google Maps
    * Volunteering recommendations and scores uploaded and available for use during search by other organizations

2. Side project idea of a game using Scratch as a fun way to make use of our first "language" and make something big out of it

3. Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning related topic as I am really interested in learning about that and implementing such project but not sure if my ideas are too big for beginner level

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names, and who are their section leaders?

I do not plan to collaborate with my classmates.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

No, just guidance over which project would be better executed.
